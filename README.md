# Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL) Implementation in C

## Overview
This project implements a **Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL)** in C, allowing users to dynamically manage a list of nodes. The program provides functionalities such as adding, deleting, and printing nodes in both forward and reverse order.

## Features
- **Create a Circular Doubly Linked List**
- **Add a Node** at the end of the list
- **Insert a Node** at a specific position
- **Delete a Node** by value
- **Delete a Node** at a specific position
- **Print the List** (forward and reversed)

## Files
- `main.c`: Contains the full implementation of the CDLL with a menu-driven interface.
- Makefile: Auto runs the script for best practices and ease of use. 

## Example Run
```
Please select a number to do the following operation:
1
Please enter a value: 10
